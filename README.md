      In a massive warehouse, Zara manages 106 containers, numbered from 1 to 106, each holding a value equal to its
      number. Due to special instructions, the values of containers within specified ranges [P, Q] are changed to
      zero. Given M such ranges, which may overlap, calculate the total sum of all container values after applying
      these instructions.

    Constraints:
      0 ≤ M ≤ 105
      1 ≤ P ≤ Q ≤ 106
      </p>
